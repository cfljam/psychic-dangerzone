### Case-building for OSX Option for Scientific Computing

As suggested/requested by Kieran 28 Jan 2015:

High Level Context/Needs
--------
1.  modern scientific computing requires working with a diverse set of mature to emerging tools
2.  most software is developed for Unix-flavour OSes (OSX and Linux) and open-source scripting languages (eg Python, Perl) 
3.  these must usually be installed, compiled and updated using command-line tools including compilers, compression and source control utilities etc etc 
4.  analysis is not sufficient without data import, export, reporting and communication tools
5. modern web deployment technologies are emerging as an important means to develop, test and deploy applications and reproducible computing environments for our science.


Things we Can't Do
--------------
1. Windows lacks all the foundation tools listed above
2. We cant work at the command-line. Most critically, Windows lacks a usable POSIX compliant shell.
3. We cant', or we cant be bothered, configuring  Windows ports for such tools. If available their configuration is complex, buggy , time-consuming, poorly-documented and/or supported
4. We cant bridge the **deep** divide between scientific computing acitivities running on Open Source/Linux and corporate documentation and communication tools.
5. We cant access bleeding edge development and computational tools which tend to be ported late, if at all, to Windows
6. We can't establishand migrate  a productive analytical environment for gleaning value from complex biological data without substantial workarounds, shadow-IT solutions and personal sysadmin effort.
